# Minecraft Bedrock Server Status Monitor (Discord notifications)

A lightweight and small monitor for a **Minecraft Bedrock server** that checks the server status and player counts periodically and sends notifications to a Discord channel via webhook.

What it does:
- Periodically queries the [Minecraft Server Status API](https://mcsrvstat.us/) for a configured bedrock server.
- Detects server ONLINE/OFFLINE transitions
- Detects gamemode changes
- Detects player join/leave events (only player count changes)

Key configuration (environment variables):
- `MC_SERVER` (required): host[:port] of the Bedrock server to monitor (example: `play.example.com:19132`).
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional): Discord webhook URL to post notifications. If not set, notifications are skipped and messages are printed only to stdout.
- `CHECK_INTERVAL` (optional): seconds between checks (default: `300`). Keep in mind that the API is currently free to use and consider donating to keep it online.
- `DATA_FILE` (optional): path inside the container where state is stored (default: `/app/server_data.json` or the value passed in compose). Use a volume to persist it across restarts.

Example outputs:
- Server went online:
    - `‚úÖ The server is now ONLINE! (Version: 1.19.x)`
- Server went offline:
    - `‚ùå The server is now OFFLINE.`
- Gamemode changed (while online):
    - `‚ÑπÔ∏è Gamemode changed to: survival`
- Player joined/left (while online):
    - `üéÆ A player joined! 3/10 players online.`
    - `üëã A player left. 1/10 players online.`
