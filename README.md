# Minecraft Server Status - Discord Monitor

A lightweight and small monitor for **Minecraft servers** (both Java and Bedrock) that checks the server status and player counts periodically and sends notifications to a Discord channel via webhook.

What it does:
- Periodically queries the [Minecraft Server Status API](https://mcsrvstat.us/) for the configured server
- Detects server ONLINE/OFFLINE transitions
- Monitors server version changes
- Detects player join/leave events
- For Bedrock servers:
  - Detects gamemode changes
  - Shows player count updates
- For Java servers:
  - Shows player names when they join
  - Displays server software and MOTD
  - Reports plugin and mod counts

### Key configuration (environment variables):
- `SERVER_TYPE` (optional): set to `JAVA` or `BEDROCK`. If not set, defaults to `BEDROCK`
- `MC_SERVER` (required): host[:port] of the server to monitor
  - For Bedrock servers: `play.example.com:19132`
  - For Java servers: `play.example.com:25565` (25565 is default Java port)
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional): Discord webhook URL to post notifications. If not set, notifications are skipped and messages are printed only to stdout
- `CHECK_INTERVAL` (optional): seconds between checks (default: `300`). Keep in mind that the API is currently free to use and consider donating to keep it online

### Example outputs:

Common notifications:
- Server status changes:
    - `✅ The server is now ONLINE!`
    - `❌ The server is now OFFLINE.`
